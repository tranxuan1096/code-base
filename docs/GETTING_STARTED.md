- Feel free to add more sub-folder in `features`. E.g: `dashboard`, `admin`

## Env variable import:
1. You need to add type in [env.d.ts](./src/env.d.ts) like "readonly VITE_ANYTHING: string"
2. Variables MUST start with `VITE_`
3. Usage of env variable in your app, no need to import, just use it as a global variable: `console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL)`
